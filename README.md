# PDSFit

## Description
PDSFit is a software that allows the extraction of inter-spin distance distributions and, in some cases, angular distributions from primary time traces acquired by pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy (PDS). This data analysis is performed via the model-based simulation or fitting of the time traces, using a parametrized geometric model of the spin system and a parametrized model of the PDS background. The features that determine the application field of PDSFit are listed below:

•	PDSFit can be applied to time traces acquired with the pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR or DEER) and relaxation-induced dipolar modulation enhancement (RIDME) techniques.

•	PDSFit can be applied to the time traces with or without orientation selectivity.

•	PDSFit can be applied to spin systems consisting of up to two spin centers with (highly) anisotropic g-factors.

•	PDSFit can be applied to spin systems with nonzero exchange coupling if the exchange coupling constant falls into the weak exchange limit.
